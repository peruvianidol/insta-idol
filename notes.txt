SETUP
* Used ChatGPT to generate setup script(s):
* Compile igtv, posts, reels, stories in your_instagram_activity/content/
* Group media by creation_timestamp for posts with multiple images/videos
* Sort by creation_timestamp in descending order
* Get title, creation_timestamp from post, when post has multiple media, else from media if only one exists
* Optional: Get latitude, longitude from media exif_data
* Upon uploading to Cloudinary, create _data/posts.json with simplified JSON data
* Note: Some video files may not include .mp4 extension
* Note: Titles with emoji/accents may not render correctly -- need to add emoji back in manually.

ELEVENTY
* Add eleventy filters for limiting posts, date conversion, adding optimization parameters to Cloudinary images
* Paginate through _data/posts.json
* Show the first image in a post, place inside button that triggers full size media in a dialog
* Show icons when multiple media present or media is video

JS
* Use localstorage to persist list/grid preference between page loads
* Close dialog when clicking on backdrop
* Stop video and reset to beginning when closing dialog

MISTAKES
* Had to manually add videos from non-posts folders
* Posts with multiple media had no title, had to add manually
